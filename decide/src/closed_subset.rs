//! This attempts to decide machines by "static analysis" â€“ if in the state
//! transition graph, there is no path from a particular state to a halting
//! transition, then the state is a "non-halting state".
//!
//! Due to how the database is constructed, all non-halting transitions are
//! guaranteed to be reachable. As such, we don't even need to execute the
//! machines.
